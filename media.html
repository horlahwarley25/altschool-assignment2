          fascination for technology. He attended Barth Academy for primary school
          and Matvot College for secondary school, graduating in 2017. He is
          currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Yaba College of
          Technology.

          his technical skills and fueled his passion for technology. In 2024,
          Moses joined AltSchool Africa to specialize in frontend engineering,
